//    Lab: using the mock fetch user function provided,
//    store the user in the redux store and access that
//    data from the header to show the user first name.

// - dispatch an action with the user data after the "server" returns the user data.
//     since we are now dispatching we need a reducer that can read that action and change the state accordingly.
// - Create a reducer function to handle the user part of the redux state.
// - give that reducer to redux so that redux can call/run it every time an action is dispatched. (pass the reducer to redux where you create the redux store so that redux can call it)

// - In the header component use the 'useSelector()' hook to grab the userdata from the redux store and diplay it.
